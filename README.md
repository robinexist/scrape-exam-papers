this file gets past papers from a specific website that normally hosts all university pastpapers

unfortunatly the website is shit and the search bar doesnt work so i made code that bypasses that need

TO USE
you need the following
python
pip
requests
beutifulsoup4
selenium
threading
time

YOU WILL ALSO NEED
firefox and the firefox driver to bot firefox (i couldnt get it working on chrome, sorry)

FINALLY
put your details in the code {username, passwords} and the university you go to and the module letter code you are looking for and run that

output is an array of links to past papers of the subject you are looking for

DISCLAMER
this isnt a hack its a scrape thats why it needs your details becasue its not a work around the website just the search bar.
